# Case Study Scenarios to discuss

## Scenario 1: Cost Allocation and Tracking
**Situation**: The company needs to track and allocate costs accurately across different Warehouses and Stores. The costs include labor, inventory, transportation, and overhead expenses.

**Task**: Discuss the challenges in accurately tracking and allocating costs in a fulfillment environment. Think about what are important considerations for this, what are previous experiences that you have you could related to this problem and elaborate some questions and considerations

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ In a warehouse fulfillment environment, accurately tracking and allocating costs across different warehouses and stores is challenging because operations involve many shared activities and resources. Costs such as labor, inventory handling, transportation, and overhead expenses are rarely tied to a single location or process. Employees may work across multiple warehouses, transportation vehicles may serve several stores in one route, and operational expenses like utilities or system infrastructure support the entire network rather than one facility. Because inventory continuously moves between suppliers, warehouses, and stores, determining where costs should be assigned becomes complex. Without proper tracking mechanisms, organizations risk inaccurate financial reporting, poor profitability analysis, and inefficient decision-making. From a system perspective, successful cost allocation depends on capturing operational events in real time and linking them to financial data so that each warehouse reflects its true operational performance. A major consideration is balancing accuracy with practicality — overly complex allocation models may be difficult to maintain, while overly simple models may misrepresent actual costs. Therefore, integrating warehouse operations, logistics data, and financial systems becomes essential to achieve transparent and reliable cost tracking.
How should shared resources like labor and transportation be fairly distributed across multiple warehouses or stores?
How can real-time warehouse events be captured to improve cost accuracy?
How frequently should cost allocations be recalculated to reflect changing operations?]

## Scenario 2: Cost Optimization Strategies
**Situation**: The company wants to identify and implement cost optimization strategies for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to reduce overall costs without compromising service quality.

**Task**: Discuss potential cost optimization strategies for fulfillment operations and expected outcomes from that. How would you identify, prioritize and implement these strategies?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Cost optimization in fulfillment operations focuses on reducing expenses while maintaining service quality. This can be achieved by improving warehouse layout, optimizing inventory levels, consolidating shipments, and automating repetitive tasks. Data analysis helps identify inefficiencies such as excess inventory, unused space, or inefficient delivery routes. Strategies should be prioritized based on impact and ease of implementation, then introduced gradually with performance monitoring. Expected outcomes include lower operational costs, improved efficiency, and faster, more reliable fulfillment.
Which operations contribute most to costs?
Which optimizations give quick cost savings?
How can service quality be maintained during cost reduction?]

## Scenario 3: Integration with Financial Systems
**Situation**: The Cost Control Tool needs to integrate with existing financial systems to ensure accurate and timely cost data. The integration should support real-time data synchronization and reporting.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of integrating the Cost Control Tool with financial systems. What benefits the company would have from that and how would you ensure seamless integration and data synchronization?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Integrating the Cost Control Tool with existing financial systems is important to ensure that operational cost data from warehouses is accurately reflected in financial reporting. Without integration, manual data transfers can cause delays, inconsistencies, and reporting errors. Real-time synchronization allows financial teams to monitor expenses, profitability, and operational performance using up-to-date information. This integration improves transparency between operations and finance, supports faster decision-making, and enables better budgeting, forecasting, and cost control. Seamless integration can be ensured by using standardized APIs, consistent data formats, automated synchronization processes, proper validation rules, and continuous monitoring to maintain data accuracy and system reliability.
How can data consistency be maintained between systems?
Which integration method (API, events, batch sync) is most suitable?]

## Scenario 4: Budgeting and Forecasting
**Situation**: The company needs to develop budgeting and forecasting capabilities for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to predict future costs and allocate resources effectively.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of budgeting and forecasting in fulfillment operations and what would you take into account designing a system to support accurate budgeting and forecasting?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ Budgeting and forecasting help fulfillment operations predict future costs, plan resources, and maintain efficiency as demand changes. By analyzing historical data, order trends, labor needs, inventory levels, and transportation expenses, companies can estimate future spending and allocate resources effectively. A good system should combine operational and financial data, update forecasts regularly, and support scenario planning to improve decision-making and cost control.

## Scenario 5: Cost Control in Warehouse Replacement
**Situation**: The company is planning to replace an existing Warehouse with a new one. The new Warehouse will reuse the Business Unit Code of the old Warehouse. The old Warehouse will be archived, but its cost history must be preserved.

**Task**: Discuss the cost control aspects of replacing a Warehouse. Why is it important to preserve cost history and how this relates to keeping the new Warehouse operation within budget?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
[ When replacing an existing warehouse with a new one, cost control becomes important to ensure operational continuity without losing financial visibility. Even though the new warehouse reuses the same Business Unit Code, the old warehouse’s historical cost data must be preserved to maintain accurate financial records, audits, and performance comparisons. Cost history helps the organization understand past operational expenses, identify trends, and evaluate whether the new warehouse improves efficiency or increases costs. Preserving this information allows management to set realistic budgets for the new warehouse based on previous spending patterns while avoiding repeated inefficiencies. It also ensures transparency in reporting and supports long-term financial planning.
How can performance improvements be measured after replacement?
How can the company prevent cost overruns during the transition?]
